Introduction
In the digital age, where the volume of multimedia content, especially movies, is growing exponentially, the need for effective management of such resources has become crucial. The Online Movie Database Management System (OMDBMS) project was initiated to address this need. It aimed to develop a comprehensive platform for managing an extensive database of movies, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience for both movie enthusiasts and administrators. The project was executed in two distinct phases, each focusing on specific objectives and functionalities.
Phase One: Foundational Development
The first phase laid the groundwork for the OMDBMS. The central goal was to establish a robust and scalable architecture that could handle the basic requirements of movie data management.
1.	Movie Class: This class forms the core of the system. It was designed to encapsulate all the essential attributes of a movie, such as the title, director, release year, and running time. The class also included methods for managing these attributes, like getters and setters, ensuring encapsulation and data integrity.
2.	User Class: Recognizing the importance of user interaction with the system, the User Class was created. This class stored vital user information, including usernames and passwords. It was crucial for implementing functionalities like user registration, login, and data validation. To ensure persistent data storage, the system employed file reading and writing operations.
3.	MovieDatabase Class: Serving as the backbone of the OMDBMS, this class was responsible for storing and managing the collection of Movie objects. It included methods for adding, removing, and retrieving movies, as well as ensuring the integrity of the database by preventing duplicate entries.
4.	Graphical User Interface (GUI): To make the system user-friendly, a basic GUI was developed using Java Swing. This interface allowed users to browse through movies and manage their personal watchlists, providing an interactive experience.
The codebase in this phase adhered to object-oriented programming principles, focusing on modularity and scalability. This approach facilitated future enhancements and maintenance.
Phase Two: Advanced Enhancements
Building upon the solid foundation laid in the first phase, the second phase of development introduced sophisticated features and enhancements to improve user experience.
1.	Enhanced System Design: The system's robustness was amplified through advanced exception handling. This ensured smooth handling of scenarios like invalid user inputs and requests for unavailable movies. The use of Stream API and lambda functions enabled efficient execution of complex operations like sorting and filtering. Furthermore, the integration of the Collections framework significantly improved the system's data handling capabilities.
2.	Advanced User Interface: The GUI was enhanced with features for sorting and filtering movies based on various criteria. This not only made the system more user-friendly but also allowed for a more personalized experience. The watchlist feature was also upgraded, enabling users to manage their lists effectively, with changes being persistent across sessions.
3.	Data Management: The system's data management capabilities were expanded to include a comprehensive database of registered users. This enhancement was pivotal in ensuring that the system could manage data securely and persistently.
4.	Technical Improvements: The second phase witnessed a significant improvement in code quality and application of advanced OOP concepts. Special attention was given to performance optimization, leveraging Java's advanced features for optimal system efficiency.
Challenges and Solutions
Throughout its development, the OMDBMS faced various challenges:
•	Data Integrity: One of the primary challenges was ensuring that no duplicate movies were added to the database. This was addressed through rigorous checks and validation mechanisms in the MovieDatabase class.
•	Exception Handling: Developing a user-friendly error handling system was challenging. The solution was to implement custom exceptions and provide meaningful error messages, enhancing the user's experience and system reliability.
Conclusion
The development of the Online Movie Database Management System is a prime example of applying modern software development practices to create a robust, scalable, and efficient platform. It showcases the effective use of object-oriented programming principles, advanced Java features, and comprehensive testing and documentation. This project not only fulfills its intended functionalities but also sets a benchmark for similar systems in terms of scalability and user experience. The OMDBMS stands as a testament to the capabilities of modern software engineering in creating solutions that are both powerful and user-friendly.
